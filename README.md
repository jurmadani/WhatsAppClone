## Configuration

Before running the application, you need to configure Firebase services. Follow the steps below:

Create a Firebase project at https://firebase.google.com if you haven't already.
- Enable Firebase Authentication, Firestore, and Firebase Storage for your project.
- Obtain the Firebase configuration object from the Firebase console.
- Update the Firebase configuration in the project code.
- Create a folder "backend" with file firebase.ts and replace the following lines with your Firebase configuration:

```bash
import firebase from "firebase/compat/app";
import "firebase/compat/auth";
import "firebase/compat/firestore";
import "firebase/compat/storage"
import "firebase/compat/database"

const firebaseConfig = {
 //your config goes here
};

if (!firebase.apps.length) {
  const app = firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig);

}

export { firebase };

```
    

## Deployment

To deploy this project run

## Problem Approach
- Analyzed project requirements and identified specific needs and features for each application.
- Researched and evaluated technologies and frameworks for cross-platform compatibility, performance, and developer experience.
- Set up the development environment and configured necessary tools, libraries, and dependencies.
- Used a modular architecture pattern, separating the code into small, reusable components, to ensure seperation of concerns and efficient testing.
- Used Git for collaboration, code management, and change tracking.

## If time was infinite
 Given infinite time, here are some exciting features I would add to enhance the user experience:
- Group Chat: Foster seamless collaboration and teamwork through group conversations.
- Video/Audio Calls: Enable real-time video and audio calls to connect people across distances.
- Message Reactions: Express emotions and provide quick feedback with message reactions.
- Swipe to Reply: Streamline conversations with an intuitive swipe-to-reply feature.
